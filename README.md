# ShopX: buy or gift an experience of a lifetime

## About

Welcome to 'ShopX'. ShopX is a simulation of an e-shop that fulfills the urge of ‘buying smth new’ while saving the planet from extra junk we consume every day. The idea behind it was to minimize tangible purchases but still being able to make a great gift to yourself or a loved one. PLEASE BE AWARE that this is a simulation e-commerce only, payment information is not beign saved into teh database or processed by a payment system.

This project was created with [Fullstack Academy Boilermaker](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker) as a starting point.

It utilizes React/Redux on the front-end and Node.js on the back-end with a Postgres database saving users and their order for persistent cart across multiple devices. Guest experience is in progress.

## How to run the project

In the project directory, please run the following commands in the presented order:

- Make sure your Postgres database is running!
- `npm install`
- Create 2 databases: `createdb shop-x` & `createdb shop-x-test`(the second one is used for running tests)
- Seed the database: `npm run seed` (please bear in mind that database will re-seed every time you run this command)
- Start the server and run the app in the development mode: `npm run start-dev`
- Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.
